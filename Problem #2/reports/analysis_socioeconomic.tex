\subsection{Socioeconomic correlates of exposure}
\label{sec:socioeconomic}
To understand the equity implications of GenAI exposure, we analyze how \NetRisk{} correlates with annual wages and education levels (proxied by O*NET Job Zones).

\subsubsection{Wage Correlation}
We hypothesize that unlike previous automation waves which targeted lower-wage routine tasks, GenAI exposure increases with wage. Figure~\ref{fig:wage_risk} plots the Annual Mean Wage (BLS OEWS 2024) against \NetRisk{}. The analysis confirms a distinct positive correlation ($r \approx 0.38$, $\rho \approx 0.51$), indicating that higher-paid occupations face greater exposure. This reversal of historical trends suggests that GenAI targets the cognitive premiums of high earners rather than the manual labor of low earners. Table~\ref{tab:analysis_wage_corr} details the correlation statistics.

\subsubsection{Education and Preparation}
We examine exposure across O*NET Job Zones (1=Little Prep to 5=Extensive Prep). Figure~\ref{fig:job_zone} reveals a structural ``risk cliff'' between medium and considerable preparation. Zones 1--3 remain sheltered with negative average \NetRisk{} ($-0.48$, $-0.35$, and $-0.12$ respectively), shielded by physical and onsite requirements. However, risk shifts sharply positive in Zone 4 (Considerable Prep, Mean Risk $+0.50$) and Zone 5 (Extensive Prep, $+0.45$). This implies that the bachelor's degree barrier, traditionally a moat against automation, now defines the zone of highest exposure.
