 Under immediate High disruption vs.\ baseline, employment shifts by: Software Developers (\(\EBaseSoftware \rightarrow \EHighSoftware\)) (\(\DeltaEHighSoftware\)), Electricians (\(\EBaseElectrician \rightarrow \EHighElectrician\)) (\(\DeltaEHighElectrician\)), Writers and Authors (\(\EBaseWriter \rightarrow \EHighWriter\)) (\(\DeltaEHighWriter\)). As an alternative prior-based scenario, Career-prior High gives: Software Developers (\(\EBaseSoftware \rightarrow \ECareerPriorHighSoftware\)) (\(\DeltaECareerPriorHighSoftware\)), Electricians (\(\EBaseElectrician \rightarrow \ECareerPriorHighElectrician\)) (\(\DeltaECareerPriorHighElectrician\)), Writers and Authors (\(\EBaseWriter \rightarrow \ECareerPriorHighWriter\)) (\(\DeltaECareerPriorHighWriter\)); note this can be more severe than the global High for some careers. Ramp adoption reduces the magnitude of disruption: Software Developers (\(\EBaseSoftware \rightarrow \ERampHighSoftware\)) (\(\DeltaERampHighSoftware\)), Electricians (\(\EBaseElectrician \rightarrow \ERampHighElectrician\)) (\(\DeltaERampHighElectrician\)), Writers and Authors (\(\EBaseWriter \rightarrow \ERampHighWriter\)) (\(\DeltaERampHighWriter\)) (Table~\ref{tab:scenario_summary}).
