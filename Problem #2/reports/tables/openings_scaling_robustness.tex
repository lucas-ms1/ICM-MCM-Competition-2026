\caption{Robustness check for scaling national annual openings (EP) to local markets (OEWS). We compare (i) openings scaled by local occupation share only, (ii) openings scaled by local total employment share $\times$ LQ (standard decomposition), and (iii) a legacy method multiplying occupation share by clipped LQ (shown for comparison; can double-count concentration). Note that (i) and (ii) are algebraically equivalent when LQ is computed from the same OEWS employment counts; differences arise only from clipping or inconsistent sources. The seats in Table~\ref{tab:program_sizing} use method (ii) with clipped LQ.}
