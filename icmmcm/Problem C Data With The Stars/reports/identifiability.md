# Identifiability of fan votes

- **Percent rule (seasons 3–27):** Only vote **shares** f_{i,t} matter (c_i = j_i + f_i). Absolute vote totals V are not identified.
- **Rank rule (seasons 1–2, 28–34):** Only **ordering** of votes matters (rank by V). Not even shares are identified.
- **Absolute fan vote totals** are therefore intrinsically underidentified.

**Reporting convention:**

1. **Primary outputs:** Report fan vote **shares** f_{i,t} in [0, 1], with sum over active set = 1 for each (season, week).
2. **Index-scaled totals:** Any conversion to “vote totals” (e.g. sum_i V_{i,t} = 10,000,000) is for presentation only and must be **labeled clearly** as “index-scaled total,” not as true vote count.
